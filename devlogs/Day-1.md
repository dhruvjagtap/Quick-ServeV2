# ðŸš€ Quick Serve â€“ Day 1

Today I officially started rebuilding **Quick Serve v2**, a real-time service booking app using **React Native CLI** + **Firebase**.

## âœ… What I Did

- Set up React Native CLI project
- Integrated Firebase SDK (Auth & Firestore)
- Implemented registration & login screens (UI only)
- Created mock UI for service cards

## ðŸ”§ Tech Focus

- React Native CLI
- Firebase Auth
- Modular folder structure

## ðŸ’¬ Thought of the Day

"I will build one solid feature at a time â€” clean, reusable, and understood."

## ðŸ“Œ What's Next

- Complete Firebase Auth logic
- Implement user role routing (Customer / Provider)

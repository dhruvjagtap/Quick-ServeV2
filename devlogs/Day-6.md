# Day 6 â€“ Quick Serve v2

## ðŸ’¤ No development today

Had a full day at college (10 AM â€“ 5 PM) and returned late due to traffic.  
Feeling exhausted and taking today to rest.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

"Rest is part of the process. Missing a day doesn't mean I'm off track."

## ðŸ”œ Coming Up Next

- Home screens for both roles (customer & provider)
- UI layout planning & dynamic rendering
